        <p>Thank you for choosing CSVLink. We want to be transparent about our policies so you know exactly what to expect when using our platform and purchasing subscriptions or templates.</p>
        
        <h3>1. Free-to-Use Tool</h3>
        <p>The CSVLink tool itself offers a free tier that you can use to design and customize templates. We encourage users to try the free tier before committing to a paid subscription.</p>

        <h3>2. Subscriptions</h3>
        <p>Pro subscriptions provide access to premium features. You can cancel your subscription at any time. Refunds for subscriptions are generally not provided, but we may consider them on a case-by-case basis if there was a technical issue that prevented you from using the service.</p>

        <h3>3. Store Templates</h3>
        <p>When you decide to purchase a template from our store, you are paying for immediate access to a digital product. <strong>All store template sales are final and we do not accept refunds once the product has been accessed or downloaded.</strong></p>

        <h3>4. Support</h3>
        <p>If you encounter any issues or have questions about our billing, please contact our support team. We are committed to ensuring you have a great experience with CSVLink.</p>
